# AnomalyDetection
Python project that uses K-Means clustering on 8-dimensional soil sensor data to flag point anomalies (weird sensor readings) and visualize them with PCA and boxplots.
How It Works

Load & parse the CSV (pandas).

Z-score normalize all 8 features so they share the same scale.

Run K-Means (k=2) in the 8-D space to split data into two clusters.

Label the smaller cluster as anomalies (is_anomaly_point = 1).

Save results to anomaly_flags.csv.

Visualize with PCA (8D â†’ 2D) and feature boxplots.
